    "#### Question 1.1\n",
    "Politician Ronald Rump claims that allowing more non-citizens ($X=3, X=4$) to live and work in Canada will lower the average wage in Canada. Is this true? Why or why not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1.1\n",
    "Yes, this is true as long as those immigrants would earn less than the average wage. That is because $X=3, X=4$ type immigrants would be making up a larger share of the population, but the _conditional_ mean wage of those immigrants would be lower still.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1.2\n",
    "No, in this analysis the mean wages for each group remain the same as $X=3, X=4$ type immigrants increase. So in is not true that more immigrants would result in lower wages for any group.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1.3\n",
    "Because immigrants would be making up a larger portion of the whole population, and the conditional expected wage of immigrants is lower, the mean wage would decrease. This analysis still makes sense even when the conditional expected wage of the other groups is unchanged.\n",

Since most immigrants to Canada come from India, China, the Philippines, Nigeria, or the United States, she claims that on average, citizen of those countries must be more highly educated than Canadians. Is this true? What is another reason immigrant Canadians might be more highly educated than native-born Canadians?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1.4\n",
    "This is not necessarily true. Immigrant Canadians were able to gain Canadian citizenship perhaps in part because of their higher educational status.

    "#### Answer 2.3\n",
    "The behavior most costly to the individual is illegal drugs, which increase the expected health care cost of an individual by ($150,000$). However, the activity that is most costly to the government is alcohol. This is because most of the population (75%) is consuming alcohol, and it is still very costly per person (if not the most). However, a much lower percentage (4%) are consuming illegal drugs. So even thought it is the most expesive per individual, it is not the biggest source of government spending.\n",

    "Of course, it is very likely that the response to the campaign would not have a uniform effect, but rather depend on the behavior that's being targeted. For example, some of the behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol, or drugs can be addictive, so a campaign may be less able to discourage them.\n",

    "#### Answer 2.5\n",

    "#### Answer 2.6\n",
    "Now a 5% decrease in the number of people who consume alcohol will save the government more than a 10% in the number of people who speed. So in this case the taskforce should target alcohol.\n",
